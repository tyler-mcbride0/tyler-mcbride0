<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler McBride.</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full-Stack Web Developer</h3>

I recently started my development journey at [Dev Academy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/) to launch me into a tech career. An amazing experience that hasn't just set me up and made me work ready but dived deep into connecting with others and the soft skills that I value highly.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an official portfolio to showcase my projects as well as creating new web sites for my local squash clubs.
- ðŸŒ± new to picking up three.js and all the possibilities it unlocks for interactive web development.
